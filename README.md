# About Us
We're a team of lifelong learners, an enthusiast community to support individuals, businesses, and educators through the lifelong learning revolution.

In other words, "The AS8 organization" is a community for Bangladeshi developers to collaborate on open-source projects and connect with others. There are tons of resources on the internet, but most of the typical Bangladeshi students find it difficult to start their programming journey. We are here to help you out by providing necessary resources, mentorship, and organizing code jams, hackathons, and different events throughout the year. Our vision is to inspire a lifelong love of learning in innovative ways and to create a learning experience that is fun, fruitful, and rewarding.
